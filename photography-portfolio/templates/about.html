    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Karthik, a passionate photographer from Kerala. I specialize in capturing portraits, rituals, nature, and animals. I use a Canon 2000D and run an Instagram page called <a href="https://instagram.com/look._throght_my_camer" target="_blank">@look._throght_my_camer</a>.</p>
    <p>My dream is to become a professional photographer and run my own company after completing my studies in photography.</p>
